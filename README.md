# Are women better than men and multitasking?
This is the question Stoet, Oâ€™Connor, Conner, and Laws aimed to address in their [study](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-7283-1-18). In this project, I will replicate its experimental design. It consists of two experiments.

## Experiment 1. 
The subjects were asked to report either the shape of the frame of the stimulus or the number of circles inside of it based on the location in which the stimulus appeared. This paradigm is useful for the assessmenet of the so-called *switching cost*: the increase in response times due to a change in instructions. Figure 1 depicts an example trial.

![Figure 1. An example of the "shape" task, where the subject has to decide whether the imperative stimulus has the shape of a square of that of a diamond. The right response is "diamond".](example_trial.png)

If the imperative stimulus appeared at the top part of the screen labeled "Shape", the subject is supposed to report as quickly as possible the shape of the surrounding frame (either square or diamond). If the stimulus appeared in the bottom part of the screen labeled "Filling", the subject is supposed to report the number of circles inside the frame (either 2 or 3). All possible trials are illustrated in figure 2.

## Experiment 2
It is unclear how to replicate this part of the design since it invovles paper-pencil tasks.
